# Introduction to GIS and mapping in R using the `sf` package

In this repo, you will find the slides of my introduction to GIS and mapping in R using the `sf` package. Clone or download the repo, then just open the Rmd file and Knit it :smiley:

The data are mostly big shapefiles that you can download directly from here.

Alternatively, I also provide the html and the pdf (which I built using the awesome xaringan::decktape() function).

The first version of the slides was released on Feb 8, 2019.
